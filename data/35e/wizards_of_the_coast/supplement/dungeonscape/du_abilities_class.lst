Penetrating Strike		KEY:Rogue ~ Penetrating Strike	SORTKEY:Rogue	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.RogueTrapSense																										DESC:Creatures that have immunity to extra damage from sneak attacks are a bane to rogues everywhere. Particularly in ancient tombs where undead are common, rogues must rely on their wits to survive. You have spent a significant amount of time studying this problem and have learned ways to harm even such resilient opponents.  Lose: Trap Sense.																																																																																																																																		COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	BENEFIT:Whenever you flank a creature that is immune to extra damage from sneak attacks, you still deal extra damage equal to half your normal sneak attack dice. This benefit does not apply against creatures that cannot be flanked, nor against foes that are otherwise denied their Dexterity bonus to AC or flat-footed but not flanked.
