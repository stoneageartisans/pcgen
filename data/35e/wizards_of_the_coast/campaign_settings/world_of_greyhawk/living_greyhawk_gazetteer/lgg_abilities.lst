Baklunish Ethnicity			KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Baklunish			CATEGORY:Internal			TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Oerik Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Baklunish		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Oerik Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Baklunish]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Unspecified],[PREREGION:Bandit Kingdoms],[PREREGION:Bissel],[PREREGION:Blackmoor],[PREREGION:Bright Lands],[PREREGION:Celadon Forest],[PREREGION:Crystalmist Mountains],[PREREGION:Dyvers],[PREREGION:Ekbir],[PREREGION:Furyondy],[PREREGION:Greyhawk],[PREREGION:Empire of Iuz],[PREREGION:Ket],[PREREGION:Lortmil Mountains],[PREREGION:Plains of the Paynims],[PREREGION:Perrenland],[PREREGION:Rovers of the Barrens],[PREREGION:Tiger Nomads],[PREREGION:Tusmit],[PREREGION:Ull],[PREREGION:Valley of the Mage],[PREREGION:Vesve Forest],[PREREGION:Wolf Nomads],[PREREGION:Zeif]			SOURCEPAGE:p.5		DESC:The Baklunish have skin of golden tones, and straight, fine-textured hair that is universally dark, ranging from dusky brown to bluish black. Their eyes are usually green or gray-green; hazel and gray eyes are rare. They tend to be long of limb and facial feature, with high cheekbones.<br><b>Background:</b> The Baklunish once held a great empire on the western side of the Crystalmists and Barrier Peaks. The Invoked Devastation ruined their empire, for which the Baklunish retaliated with the Rain of Colorless Fire, burning the Suel Imperium to ash. Most surviving Baklunish moved north or west, to the borders of the old empire and beyond. The Baklunish retained much of their culture after the fall of their empire - honor, family, generosity, and piety are fundamental virtues.
Flan Ethnicity				KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Flan				CATEGORY:Internal			TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Oerik Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Flan			PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Oerik Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Flan]			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Unspecified],[PREREGION:Adri Forest],[PREREGION:Ahlissa],[PREREGION:Bandit Kingdoms],[PREREGION:Blackmoor],[PREREGION:Bone March],[PREREGION:Bright Lands],[PREREGION:Celadon Forest],[PREREGION:Celene],[PREREGION:Crystalmist Mountains],[PREREGION:Dyvers],[PREREGION:Furyondy],[PREREGION:Gamboge Forest],[PREREGION:Geoff],[PREREGION:Glorioles],[PREREGION:Gran March],[PREREGION:Greyhawk],[PREREGION:Iron Hills],[PREREGION:Empire of Iuz],[PREREGION:Keoland],[PREREGION:Lortmil Mountains],[PREREGION:North Kingdom],[PREREGION:Theocracy of the Pale],[PREREGION:Perrenland],[PREREGION:Pomarj],[PREREGION:Ratik],[PREREGION:Rovers of the Barrens],[PREREGION:Sea Princes],[PREREGION:Shield Lands],[PREREGION:Sterich],[PREREGION:Stonehold],[PREREGION:Tenh],[PREREGION:County of Ulek],[PREREGION:Duchy of Ulek],[PREREGION:Valley of the Mage],[PREREGION:Veluna],[PREREGION:Verbobonc],[PREREGION:Vesve Forest],[PREREGION:Wolf Nomads],[PREREGION:Yeomanry]			SOURCEPAGE:p.5		DESC:Pure Flan have bronze skin, varying from a light copper hue to a dark, deep brown. Flan eyes are usually dark brown, black, brown, or amber. Hair is wavy or curly and typically black or brown (or any shade between). The Flan have broad, strong faces and sturdy builds.<br><b>Background:</b> The Flan were the first known humans to live in eastern Oerik, and it is from them that the Flanaess gets its name. Although evidence exists that they once had settled nations, those vanished long ago. The Flan have always been strongly tied to the natural world, as they were nomadic hunter-gatherers for so long. They see nature as an entity to be respected but not controlled, and this is reflected in their myths, legends, and culture.
Oeridian Ethnicity			KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Oeridian			CATEGORY:Internal			TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Oerik Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Oeridian		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Oerik Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Oeridian]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Unspecified],[PREREGION:Adri Forest],[PREREGION:Ahlissa],[PREREGION:Bandit Kingdoms],[PREREGION:Bissel],[PREREGION:Blackmoor],[PREREGION:Bone March],[PREREGION:Bright Lands],[PREREGION:Celadon Forest],[PREREGION:Celene],[PREREGION:Crystalmist Mountains],[PREREGION:Dyvers],[PREREGION:Furyondy],[PREREGION:Gamboge Forest],[PREREGION:Geoff],[PREREGION:Glorioles],[PREREGION:Gran March],[PREREGION:Greyhawk],[PREREGION:Highfolk],[PREREGION:Iron Hills],[PREREGION:Irongate],[PREREGION:Empire of Iuz],[PREREGION:Keoland],[PREREGION:Ket],[PREREGION:Lendore Isles],[PREREGION:Lordship of the Isles],[PREREGION:Lortmil Mountains],[PREREGION:North Kingdom],[PREREGION:Nyrond],[PREREGION:Onnwal],[PREREGION:Theocracy of the Pale],[PREREGION:Plains of the Paynims],[PREREGION:Perrenland],[PREREGION:Pomarj],[PREREGION:Ratik],[PREREGION:Rel Astra and the Cities of the Solnor Compact],[PREREGION:Sea Barons],[PREREGION:Sea Princes],[PREREGION:Shield Lands],[PREREGION:Sterich],[PREREGION:Sunndi],[PREREGION:Tusmit],[PREREGION:County of Ulek],[PREREGION:Duchy of Ulek],[PREREGION:Principality of Ulek],[PREREGION:County of Urnst],[PREREGION:Valley of the Mage],[PREREGION:Veluna],[PREREGION:Verbobonc],[PREREGION:Vesve Forest],[PREREGION:Yeomanry]			SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:Oeridian skin tones range from tan to olive; brown and auburn hair are common, though some individuals have hair as light as honey or as dark as coal. Likewise, eye coloration is highly variable; brown and gray are seen most often. Oeridians tend to have square or oval faces and strong jaw lines.<br><b>Background:</b> After inhabiting what is now Ull for generations, barbaric Oeridians were driven east by orcs and goblins employed as mercenaries by the Baklunish and Suel. The migrating Oeridians were able fighters and battled their way across the Flanaess, driving the Suel before them and allying with the Flan, elves, dwarves, and other peoples. Ancient Oeridians were fierce warriors, yet they also were self-sacrificing and loyal. These traits are not as evident today, but many Oeridians do remain temperamental and prone to violence. They have a preference for strict social order, usually fitting themselves at the top, and their military traditions are strong.
Olman Ethnicity				KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Olman				CATEGORY:Internal			TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Oerik Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Olman			PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Oerik Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Olman]			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Unspecified],[PREREGION:Amedio Jungle],[PREREGION:Lordship of the Isles],[PREREGION:Sea Princes]			SOURCEPAGE:p.6		DESC:The Olman have skin of a rich red-brown or dark brown color. Their hair is always straight and black, and their eyes are dark, from medium brown to nearly black. Olman have high cheekbones and high-bridged noses, a trait less strong in those of common birth.<br><b>Background:</b> The Olman originated on Hepmonaland, raising a number of city-states from the jungles of that land. Through centuries of warfare, they built an empire that spanned northern Hepmonaland and reached across the Densac Gulf to include the Amedio Jungle. Internal strife and wars with another human race, the dark Touv, caused them to abandon their old cities. Modern Olman have a tribal culture, with a cleric or hereditary chief leading each tribe.
Rhennee Ethnicity			KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Rhennee			CATEGORY:Internal			TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Oerik Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Rhennee		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Oerik Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Rhennee]			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Unspecified],[PREREGION:Celadon Forest],[PREREGION:Dyvers],[PREREGION:Gamboge Forest],[PREREGION:Greyhawk],[PREREGION:County of Urnst],[PREREGION:Verbobonc]			SOURCEPAGE:p.7		DESC:The complexion of Rhenn-folk ranges from olive to tan; their hair is usually curly and tends to be black or dark brown. Most have eyes of gray, blue, or hazel, but green is known in some families. The Rhennee are generally short but strong and wiry.<br><b>Background:</b> The Rhennee are not native to Oerth; rather, they are accidental travelers from another plane or world, citizens of a lost homeland they call Rhop. Their legends say that they appeared first in the Great Kingdom, in or near the Adri Forest. Little is known of the original culture of the Rhennee, as they were absent from the Flanaess before 450 years ago and entered their current lifestyle to escape persecution. The Rhenn-folk are masters of inland sailing and navigation, and they love their nomadic and adventurous life.
Suloise Ethnicity			KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Suloise			CATEGORY:Internal			TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Oerik Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Suloise		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Oerik Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Suloise]			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Unspecified],[PREREGION:Adri Forest],[PREREGION:Ahlissa],[PREREGION:Amedio Jungle],[PREREGION:Bandit Kingdoms],[PREREGION:Bissel],[PREREGION:Blackmoor],[PREREGION:Bone March],[PREREGION:Bright Lands],[PREREGION:Celadon Forest],[PREREGION:Celene],[PREREGION:Crystalmist Mountains],[PREREGION:Dyvers],[PREREGION:Frost Barbarians],[PREREGION:Furyondy],[PREREGION:Gamboge Forest],[PREREGION:Geoff],[PREREGION:Glorioles],[PREREGION:Gran March],[PREREGION:Greyhawk],[PREREGION:Highfolk],[PREREGION:Ice Barbarians],[PREREGION:Iron Hills],[PREREGION:Irongate],[PREREGION:Empire of Iuz],[PREREGION:Keoland],[PREREGION:Ket],[PREREGION:Lendore Isles],[PREREGION:Lordship of the Isles],[PREREGION:Lortmil Mountains],[PREREGION:North Kingdom],[PREREGION:Nyrond],[PREREGION:Onnwal],[PREREGION:Plains of the Paynims],[PREREGION:Perrenland],[PREREGION:Pomarj],[PREREGION:Ratik],[PREREGION:Rel Astra and the Cities of the Solnor Compact],[PREREGION:Scarlet Brotherhood],[PREREGION:Sea Barons],[PREREGION:Sea Princes],[PREREGION:Shield Lands],[PREREGION:Snow Barbarians],[PREREGION:Sterich],[PREREGION:Stonehold],[PREREGION:Sunndi],[PREREGION:County of Ulek],[PREREGION:Duchy of Ulek],[PREREGION:Principality of Ulek],[PREREGION:County of Urnst],[PREREGION:Duchy of Urnst],[PREREGION:Veluna],[PREREGION:Verbobonc],[PREREGION:Vesve Forest],[PREREGION:Yeomanry]			SOURCEPAGE:p.8		DESC:The Suel have the lightest coloration of any known human race of the Flanaess. Their skin is fair, with an atypical proportion of albinos. Eye color is pale blue or violet, sometimes deep blue or gray. Suel hair is wiry, often curly or kinky, with fair colors such as yellow, light red, blond, and platinum blond. The Suel tend to be lean, with narrow facial features.<br><b>Background:</b> The Suel Imperium was located in what is now the Sea of Dust. Wicked and decadent, this empire was destroyed during a war with the Baklunish when the latter brought down the Rain of Colorless Fire. Suloise survivors fled in all directions, many crossing the Hellfurnaces into the Flanaess. The modern Suel have retained an affinity for family, although they often use a very narrow definition of the word to include only siblings, parents, and children. A few Suel can trace their lineage all the way back to the days of their empire.

It has shrunk in area by about half since the Great Kingdom was founded, thanks to land-clearing for farms, fires, logging, and woodcutting. Resources from the Adri include wood for shipbuilding, homes, furniture, and weapons; game animals hunted for furs, food, and trophies; fruits and nuts; and fish from the Harp River. Armed foresters led by rangers resist incursions by Ahlissa and North Kingdom. A half-dozen druidic faiths are present, notably that of Obad-Hai. Ehlonna’s faith supports the rangers and is very militant. A legendary ancient elven city is said to lie at the heart of the Adri, in a dangerous region called the Coldwood.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> NG, N, CG, CN<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Ehlonna, Elven pantheon, Obad-Hai

Centuries of conflict and wars of independence have made the kingdom a shadow of its former self. Some of the splendor remains, of course. The fabulously wealthy capital city, Kalstrand, is a haven for smugglers and black marketers.

Tribes of savage humans (Suel and Olman) live here, among fierce animals, man-eating monsters, intelligent apes, and haunted ruins. The jungle also holds many carnivorous and poisonous plants, whose medicinal and magical properties are very powerful.

The land of Blackmoor also includes the northern fringe of the Cold Marshes, and fully encompasses the Gloomfens, as the locals call the northern arm of the marshes.

While the march once held the distinction of being the northernmost frontier of Great Kingdom before the founding of Ratik, it is now steeped in discord, ruled by a coalition of invading nonhuman tribes, particularly orcs, gnolls, and ogres. Only the small, autonomous county of Knurl is secure at present, aside from a handful of nearly forgotten gnome strongholds in the Blemu Hills.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> LN, LE*, N, CE<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Beltar, Erythnul, Hextor, Kord, Oeridian agricultural gods, Orcish pantheon

Duke Karll enjoys great friendship with the generally peaceful elves and woodsmen of the western woodlands. Mighty oaks and elms grow here, tended by treants, sylvan elves, and similar beings. These folk prevent the cutting of any live tree from the forest; the humans and elves who trade with the outside world are generally herbalists. <i>Keoghtom’s Ointment</i> is said to derive from reagents gathered here. <br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> NG, N, CG<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Ehlonna, Elf pantheon, Obad-Hai

Amid the summits and valleys of the Crystalmists dwell giants, ogres, orcs, goblins, and other monsters. Precious metals and gems are found here as well, dug out by armed mountain dwarves who trade with humans on either side of the range.

The city’s position on the southern banks of the mouth of the Velverdyva River allows Dyvers to capture the flow of trade from markets such as Schwartzenbruin, Highfolk Town, Thornward, and Verbobonc. Of course, trade flows up the Velverdyva, as well, so Dyvers sees much traffic from the Nyr Dyv and her various port cities.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> LG, LN, NG, N*, CN<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Fharlanghn, Pelor, St. Cuthbert, Zilchus*, many others

This arm of the mountains is filled by the Udgru Forest, a largely untamed region where the caliph’s authority does not go unchallenged. Ekbir, located on the coast of the Dramidj Ocean, boasts one of the most imposing fortresses in all the Flanaess within her capital city. The city is also a destination for pilgrims wishing to pray at the Mosque of Al’Akbar.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> LG*, LN, NG, N<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Al’Akba*r, Geshtai*, Istus*, Mouqol*, Pelor*, other Baklunish gods

The western edge of the Spikey Forest marks the border with the Snow Barbarians, and the southern and eastern shores of the kingdom of Fruztii end at the waters of Grendep Bay. Longships of the Frost Barbarians, often in cooperation with the other Suel barbarians, raid southward in spring to pillage along the coast of the new Great Kingdom of Northern Aerdy and sometimes further south.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> N, CN*<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Kord, Llerg, Norebo, Syrul, Vatun, Xerbo

While the king has preeminence, each noble lives in a court that rivals that of the king himself. Opulence and splendor sparkle amid the seven provinces, and rivalry for reputations’ sake is not unknown.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> LG*, LN, NG<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Beory, Fharlanghn, Heironeous, Mayaheine, Rao, St. Cuthbert, Trithereon, Zilchus

Thousands of humans, gnomes, and sylvan and high elves live here among the bronzewood, oak, elm, and hornwood trees. Ogres and hobgoblins from the mountains raid woodland villages or the plains beyond. Despite the dangers, the Gamboge is fairly peaceful, ready to trade wood, fruits, nuts, or tubers to Nyrond or, less often, the Pale.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> NG, N, CG*, CN<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Ehlonna, Elven pantheon, Gnomish pantheon, Obad-Hai

Its villages are ghost towns, and armies of orcs and giants of all varieties have inhabited the cities, taking as slaves those humans they did not kill and eat. Few buildings have escaped ruin, and the land’s forests are being harvested for unknown purposes. Nearly everything that once was Geoff has been erased. The giants hold all land from the Crystalmist mountains in all directions but east, where the Realstream, Dim Forest, Oytwood, and Stark Mounds demarcate a chaotic, violent border with Gran March.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> LG, LN, NG, N, CG, CN, CE*<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Allitur, Beory, Ehlonna, Elven pantheon, Fharlanghn, Gnomish pantheon, Norebo, Obad-Hai, Pelor, Phyton, St. Cuthbert

These peaks are home to a semi-independent dwarven kingdom closely allied with Sunndi and the Iron League. Despite their general dislike of elvenkind, the proud dwarves of the Glorioles regard Ahlissa as the greater threat by far. Humans, gnomes, and halflings live on the lower slopes.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> LG*, LN, NG, N, CG<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Dwarven pantheon, Gnomish pantheon, Halfling pantheon, some others
Common Region ~ Gran March									OUTPUTNAME:Gran March								SORTKEY:Gran March									CATEGORY:Regional		TYPE:Region.OerikRegion			VISIBLE:YES			TEMPLATE:Common Region ~ Gran March									SOURCEPAGE:p.49			DESC:Gran March is an exceptionally martial nation. At age fifteen, all fit males enter mandatory conscription for a period of up to seven years. Girls may join the rank and file as well, though this is something of a modern development. The fact that many of these young men and women continue to pursue military careers after their initial enlistment periods is a testament to national pride and the respect the army receives in Gran March.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> LG, LN*, N<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Allitur, Beory, Ehlonna, Elven pantheon, Fharlanghn, Gnomish pantheon, Norebo, Obad-Hai, Pelor, Phyton, St. Cuthbert

The people of Greyhawk pursue knowledge and wealth. The University of Magical Arts and the Grey College, among its many schools, attract students from all across the land. The city of Greyhawk controls a sizable estate ranging from the northern coast of the Woolly Bay to the southern shores of Midbay in the Nyr Dyv. The Cairn Hills and the Abbor-Alz mark the eastern limits of this domain, while its western boundary is generally considered to lie within the Gnarley Forest and along the edge of the Welkwood.

Common Region ~ Highfolk									OUTPUTNAME:Highfolk									SORTKEY:Highfolk									CATEGORY:Regional		TYPE:Region.OerikRegion			VISIBLE:YES			TEMPLATE:Common Region ~ Highfolk									SOURCEPAGE:p.52			DESC:Highfolk is not so much a country as a region where a loose collection of communities has come together. It is a farmer’s paradise — simple, honest folk work the land and cooperate for mutual profit. Humans, gnomes, elves, and halflings live together in harmony, each sharing resources.

Common Region ~ Vesve Forest								OUTPUTNAME:Vesve Forest								SORTKEY:Vesve Forest								CATEGORY:Regional		TYPE:Region.OerikRegion			VISIBLE:YES			TEMPLATE:Common Region ~ Vesve Forest								SOURCEPAGE:p.142		DESC:Sometimes referred to as the High Forest, the Vesve Forest is the largest hardwood forest in all the Flanaess and is crucial to the balance of power in the north. Iuz refuses to yield his claim to the woodlands, while Furyondy and the Highfolk support those within it who fend off evil forces. Nearly twenty thousand human woodsmen dwell here, their numbers swollen by good-hearted men and women willing to lay down their lives to contain Iuz’s terrible villainy. These humans are supported by sylvan and high elves numbering more than thirteen thousand. About six thousand gnomes and three thousand halflings support this force. Additionally, about eight hundred beastmen inhabit the peaceful northwestern reaches of the forest.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> NG, N, CG, CN, CE<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Ehlonna, Elvish pantheon, Gnomish pantheon, Halfling pantheon, Iuz, some others

These instances occur so regularly that experienced merchants budget in extra time and money to atone for unexpected transgressions.<br><b>Typical Alignments:</b> N, CN*<br><b>Favored Deities:</b> Geshtai, Istus, Telchur, ancestor worship
